I want to build a modern and elegant ElectronJS App as a SaaS.

The SaaS is for the businesses who rent out their construction items e.g pipes, ladders etc.

It should have following features.

- A multistep form for setting up a business profile as an initial tour to the saas. The business profile should have business name, phone number, address and the owner name. and for sure the username and password to login their dashboard.
- The owner should be able to add the items/stock , item should have name, quantity, length and price per each attributes, the SaaS should have proper stock management system.
- We will have the Contracts there , to people/client which the owner will rent out the items. While creating a contract it should ask for the client to whom we are renting. For this we should must have client profile , a client profile should have name, address, cnic or image upload of cnic and phone numbers. 
While creating a contract, the owner must be able to search the existing contracts or create a new one.
The owner might have multiple contracts at one time, you need to keep a scenario that if a contract is open and client might return some items or rent out more so the contract must be adjsutable.
After closing a contract the owner should be able to generate the invoice in pdf, which includes the business details, client details and the items including the dates and everything.

I do not want to use the server or database. For data management please use local json files, but make sure that they are all encrypted and only the program/saas can read it. 
All data of the business including login credentials should be in json file , everything in local.

at the end , I need to have a zip file and the instructions to run the project and compile for macos/windows.
